# Connect to Opensea through Wallet Connect in Unity

## Overview
In this sample we'll dig into how to list your NFT to Opensea from your game using Openfort's [Web3 Connections API features](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/reference/api/create-a-web3-connection-object).

Web3Connections allows you to connect your in-game wallet to any application that supports [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.io) like NFT marketplaces (e.g. [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)).

In this sample we'll be using [PlayFab](https://playfab.com/) as the backend service. PlayFab is a service operated by Microsoft for game developers, offering tools for live game management, all powered by Azure's cloud infrastructure.

By integrating the [Openfort SDK](https://github.com/openfort-xyz/openfort-node) into Azure Functions, we establish a seamless connection to PlayFab. Unity clients using the PlayFab Unity SDK can tap into these functions, accessing the full range of Openfort features within the game environment.

## Application Workflow

![Integration workflow](/docs-img/playfab-opensea-workflow-img.png)

## Prerequisites
+ [Create a PlayFab account and title](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/gamemanager/quickstart)
+ Set up your Azure development environment:
    + [Configure your environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-node?pivots=nodejs-model-v4#configure-your-environment)
    + [Sign in to Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-node?pivots=nodejs-model-v4#sign-in-to-azure)
    + [Create a function app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-node?pivots=nodejs-model-v4#create-the-function-app-in-azure)
+ [Sign in to dashboard.openfort.xyz](http://dashboard.openfort.xyz) and create a new project
+ Download or clone the [sample project](https://github.com/openfort-xyz/playfab-unity-sample): 
    + Open [unity-client](https://github.com/openfort-xyz/playfab-unity-sample/tree/main/unity-client) with Unity
    + Open [azure-backend](https://github.com/openfort-xyz/playfab-unity-sample/tree/main/azure-backend) with VS Code

## Set up Openfort

1. #### [Add a Contract](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/assets/new)
   This sample requires a contract to run. We use [0x51216BFCf37A1D2002A9F3290fe5037C744a6438](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x51216bfcf37a1d2002a9f3290fe5037c744a6438) (NFT contract deployed in 11155111 Sepolia). You can use this for the guide:

   ![Alt text](/docs-img/playfab-opensea-img.png)

2. #### [Add a Policy](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/policies/new)
   We aim to cover gas fees for users. Set a new gas policy:

   ![Alt text](/docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-1.png)

   Now, add a rule so our contract uses this policy:

   ![Alt text](/docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-2.png)

## Deploy Azure Backend
Open [azure-backend](https://github.com/openfort-xyz/playfab-unity-sample/tree/main/azure-backend) with VS Code and sign in to Azure:

![Alt text](/docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-39.png)

Ensure your Function App (here, it's "openfort-playfab") is listed:

![Alt text](/docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-38.png)

In the terminal, run:
```
npm install
```

In the explorer, right-click on a function and select ***Deploy to Function App***:

<img src="docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-6.png" width="500">

Next, choose your Function App:

![Select Function App](/docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-7.png)

Then, click on ***Deploy***:

![Deploy Confirmation](/docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-8.png)

Navigate to your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and open your Function App. You should see all the functions listed:

![Alt text](/docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-10.png)

Click on any function and select ***Get Function Url***:

![Get Function URL](/docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-11.png)

Subsequently, add this URL (along with all others) to PlayFab to enable access to our Azure Functions from within PlayFab.

## Set up PlayFab Title

1. #### Register Azure Functions
    Visit the [PlayFab developer dashboard](https://developer.playfab.com/), choose your title, and click on ***Automation***:

    ![Alt text](/docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-5.png)

    Our functions are already registered. To do the same, click ***Register function*** and provide the function name along with its URL:

    <img src="docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-13.png" width="500">

    Repeat this for all deployed functions.

## Set up Azure Backend

Our Azure backend requires environment variables from both PlayFab and Openfort. Let's configure them.

1. #### Add Openfort Environment Variables
    - Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and select your Function App.
    - Under ***Configuration***, click ***New application setting***:
      
      <img src="docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-21.png" width="500">

    - Provide the following details:
      + Name: `OF_API_KEY`
      + Value: [Retrieve the **Secret key**](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/apikeys)

    - Add another application setting:
      + Name: `OF_NFT_CONTRACT`
      + Value: [Retrieve the **Contract API ID**](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/assets)

    - And another:
      + Name: `OF_SPONSOR_POLICY`
      + Value: [Retrieve the **Policy API ID**](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/policies)

    After adding these, your configuration panel should resemble the following. Click ***Save***:
    
    <img src="docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-23.png" width="500">

2. #### Add PlayFab Environment Variables
    - Visit the [PlayFab developer dashboard](https://developer.playfab.com/), select your title, and navigate to ***Settings wheel --> Title settings***:

      <img src="docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-24.png" width="500">

    - In the ***API Features*** section, copy your ***Title ID***:

      <img src="docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-29.png" width="500">

    - Under ***Secret Keys***, note down your ***Secret key***:

      ![Secret Key](/docs-img/playfab-opensea-img-26.png)

    - Return to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and choose your Function App.
    - Under ***Configuration***, select ***New application setting*** and input:
      + Name: `PLAYFAB_TITLE_ID`
      + Value: [Your Title ID]

    - Add another application setting:
